# Face_detection_using_opencv__deep_learning
This project simply detect the faces in images and in real time videos. It uses simply opencv module and its pre-trained 'dnn' module. 
As opencv comes with its deep learning pre-trained model for face detector with high accuracy. In this we have used OpenCVâ€™s deep neural network module with Caffe models. 
It comes with two set of files i.e.
1) .prototxt file which haves model architecture
2) .caffemodel file which contains weights of layers.
Make sure you download both files for successfull running of the scripts.
